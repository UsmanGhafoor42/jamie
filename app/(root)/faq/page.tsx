          "DTF printing involves printing a design onto a special film using a DTF printer and then transferring that design onto fabric using heat and pressure. Unlike screen printing or vinyl, DTF doesn‚Äôt require weeding or pretreatment for most fabrics.",

            "1. Design Preparation: You create your artwork digitally (usually in PNG format with a transparent background).",
            "2. Film Preparation: The design is printed onto a clear PET film using special DTF inks. These printers typically lay down white ink last as a backing.",
            "3. Apply Adhesive Powder: A fine powdered adhesive is applied to the wet ink on the film. This powder sticks to the inked areas only.",
            "4. Cure the Powder: The film is heated briefly (usually with a curing oven or heat press hovering above) to melt the powder into an adhesive.",
            "5. Transfer to Fabric: Place the film onto your garment and press it with a heat press. The design bonds to the fabric.",
            "6. Peel the Film: After pressing, peel the film away‚Äîeither hot or cold peel depending on the materials used.",

            "3. Peel and Stick: You peel off the backing, apply the sticker to the surface, press it down firmly, then peel off the top film‚Äîleaving just the printed design stuck in place.",
